# PIC18F4620 Projects
Projects using a PIC18F4620 Microcontroller

This repository is a collection of the work I did in my microcontroller lab class using the PIC18F4620. Each of the projects have
a schematic that show how the PIC18F was wired with external circuitry. A MPLAB PICkit was used to program the PIC18F. All of the projects
use the Microchip's MPLAB X IDE for programming. Two of the projects are in assembly with the rest in C. Each project file contains the main
C file and other header/source files along with other needed files.

All of these projects utilize many microcontroller concepts such as interrupts, I/O, Assembly & Machine Code, Timers, A/D Conversion, Serial and
Parallel Data Transmission, and CCP.

Projects include:

    Boolean Algebra Calculator (Assembly)
    Christmas Lights (Assembly)
    Christmas Lights (C)
    Digital Voltage & Ohm Meter
    I2C Bus Implementation (Temperature Sensor & System Clock)
    Interface To Infrared Remote Control To LCD Display
    Temperature & Light Sensor
    Thermostat and Fan
    Traffic Light Controller LCD Display
